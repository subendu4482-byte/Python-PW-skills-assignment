        "## Assignment Questions and Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is popular due to its simplicity and readability, extensive libraries and frameworks, versatility across various domains (web development, data science, AI, automation), a large and supportive community, and cross-platform compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes code line by line. Unlike compilers, which translate the entire code into machine code before execution, an interpreter translates and executes each statement sequentially, making it easier for debugging and dynamic execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Pre-defined keywords (or reserved words) in Python are special words that have a specific meaning and purpose within the language. They cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `True`, `False`, `None`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** No, keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers in Python. They are reserved words with special meanings to the Python interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it has been created. A mutable object can have its internal state modified without changing its identity. Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed after creation; any modification operation on an immutable object will result in a new object being created.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Lists are mutable because their elements can be added, removed, or changed after the list is created. Tuples are immutable because once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This design choice provides flexibility for lists when dynamic collections are needed and ensures data integrity and efficiency for tuples when fixed collections are required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "*   **`==` (equality operator):** Checks if the *values* of two objects are equal.\n",
        "*   **`is` (identity operator):** Checks if two variables refer to the *exact same object* in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate Boolean expressions. Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "*   **`and`:** Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n",
        "*   **`or`:** Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n",
        "*   **`not`:** Returns the inverse of the operand (flips `True` to `False` and `False` to `True`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Type casting (or type conversion) in Python is the process of converting a variable or value from one data type to another. This can be useful when you need to perform operations that require specific data types or to ensure data compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "*   **Implicit Type Casting (Coercion):** Python automatically converts one data type to another without any user intervention, typically during arithmetic operations to prevent data loss (e.g., an integer might be converted to a float if combined with a float).\n",
        "*   **Explicit Type Casting:** The user explicitly converts one data type to another using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, etc. This is done when a specific conversion is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to `True` or `False`. They allow programs to make decisions and control the flow of execution based on various situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** The `elif` (short for 'else if') statement is used in an `if...elif...else` construct to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the `if` condition is `False`, the program proceeds to check the `elif` condition. If the `elif` condition is `True`, its corresponding block of code is executed. If it's `False`, it moves to the next `elif` or `else` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "*   **`for` loop:** Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects. It is typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance or want to process each item in a collection.\n",
        "*   **`while` loop:** Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `True`. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop continues until a certain condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** A `while` loop is more suitable than a `for` loop when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition being met. For example, reading data from a file until the end of the file is reached, repeatedly prompting a user for input until valid input is provided, or implementing a game loop that continues until a player quits."
